# Android Package Uninstaller# Caution!* I'm not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed (like it did for me...).* YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.# WhyThis project was done as a research concerning the privacy status in the software that is used by people everyday, developing finally a possible solution to this in Android devices. The solution found needed technical knowledge which not all people may have, and that's why this program was done.It simply uses Android Debug Bridge from Google's _platform-tools_ to:* Let the user know which packages are installed on his device for the default user* Filter through a keyword that can be on installation path, apk name or package name* Uninstall for the default user the selected package# How to use it# Steps to reproduce development environmentYou can simply download the project and execute it to have it running. On the file `requirements.txt` you can find the needed packages to run the project. As these requirements will be installed, I recommend to use a virtual env. To install them, you just need to:```bashpip install -r requirements.txt```After this, `pip` should have successfully installed all the necessary packages. Following this, you will also need to install the main project folder as a package, as it uses different modules and it was needed to properly define imports having a main module defined. To do so, you will need to:```bashpip install -e .```Finally, for running the project, you should just run:```bashpython main.py```# Creating standalone app for your environmentWIP## Steps to create Windows standalone appWIP## Steps to create macOs standalone appWIP## Steps to create Linux standalone appWIP# Thanks
